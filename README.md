This project lets the user create an account and also sign in. The input is connected to a SQL database I created which uses Express Validator and BCrypt to hash passwords. The database is a MySQL database built on DBeaver, and the backend repo connects to it using REST. This project will in the future be built into a real estate application.

Will upload the backend database to a web-host later on - In the meantime I have pushed the frontend repo to Netlify.
