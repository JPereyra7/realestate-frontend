This project lets the user create an account and also sign in. The input is connected to a non-relational database (MongoDB) I created which uses BCrypt to hash password credentials in order to apply a layer of security. The server side was using REST Api with endpoints for CRUD operations.

The backend db is uploaded to Heroku and the frontend is pushed to Netlify ðŸš€
